```
Build an integration layer where profile data from multiple channels 
(both online & offline â€“ ex: CSD Tills, Support Centres) are recd., 
in daily batches having the last 90-day spend.
```

```
Identify segments that will divide customers 
into three equal groups based on the 90-day spend data

- ~100,000 profile changes from across ~3500 stores 
    (Including updates, activations & de-activations)
- Profile changes recd. as files in CSV format, via FTP/SFTP
- All Stores transmit the files almost at the same time
- ~3500 files to be processed, every day
```
